            <p>Welcome to the SKCH Alumni Portal


                “Memories linger. Sweet memories linger longer.”

                Kumarans has grown tremendously the last fifty years and so has its student force. Students have disseminated the values of a true Kumaranite as is evident in whatever vocation they have pursued. CEOs, CFOs, actors, businessmen, doctors, software professionals are the diverse alumni we have globally.
                To commemorate the 50 years of our progress as an instituition, we invite our former students to reconnect with their Alma Mater.We thought the time is right to build a vibrant network to share mutual progressive views.

                Let us relive those nostalgic moments and trace the path of our progress together. And yes, do spread the good word around.

                        Smt. R.Anasuya Devi, the founder is a true example of a light that has kindly led and a beacon that has inspired thousands of people. Life was not easy when she came to Bangalore as a young widow with two children. She educated herself to secure a teaching job in a school in North Bangalore. The idea to start a school came to her when she realized that the middle class families in South Bangalore had to send their children to the Cantonment area for good education.

                        Her primary vision was to provide a home away from home, with a supportive and stimulating environment. Smt.R.A.Devi started the nursery school on a small scale at Tata Silk Farm in the year 1959. Every child deserves a head start in life. From the beginning she ensured excellent education to all the children who entered the portals of the school.

                        The school has grown to what it is today because of her noble ideals of fostering strong values, mutual understanding, respect for culture and high personal endeavor .The school’s motto is inspired by her life and the ideologies that she stood for – to inspire young minds and nurture students for their glorious future.</p>
